// Action caller is authenticated, and whether a credentials payload is
// well-formed — live here, deliberately free of any `next-auth` / `next/server`
// import. `lib/auth.ts` wires these into the NextAuth config and adapts the
// results to `NextResponse` / thrown errors; `middleware.ts` consumes the
// matcher. Keeping the pure logic here means it can be exercised in a plain
// Node unit test (the NextAuth config module can't be imported outside a Next
// runtime), so the auth gate is validated beyond the happy path. See
// `SECURITY.md` → "Authentication model" and `test/unit/auth-gate.test.ts`.
